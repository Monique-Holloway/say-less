# Say Less

This project was a full-stack project that required a healthy dose of time to complete, as I was the sole contributor. The motivation behind this project was to create a responsive website that would allow visitors to create a login, read blog posts, like/dislike posts & delete posts as well.

Languages and frameworks used for this project include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, FakerJS, & PostgreSQL.

Some challenges faced were tying the delete button to the creator of the blog post and not everyone, as well as getting the like/dislike buttons to have counters on them.  Overall, the project functioned using the CRUD method, but better functionality and individuality could've been executed, making for a better user experience.
